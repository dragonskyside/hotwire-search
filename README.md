# README

I created this simple app to explore hotwire the new technology that replaces - for the most part- React in many rails applications. The app cosists of a players model that can be populated and searched thorough a form. The interesting thing is that search queries can be updated in real time, allowing the user see results as they type. 

Dependencies:

* Ruby 3.0.3

* Rails 7.0.0 (Node and Stimulus come bundled with Rails 7)

* Node v17.3.0
